# Digital-Modulation-BER-Analysis-BPSK-QPSK-QAM
This project presents a comparative analysis of the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance of BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM, and 64-QAM modulation schemes over an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel. MATLAB and Simulink are used to visualize constellation diagrams and evaluate the impact of noise on system performance
